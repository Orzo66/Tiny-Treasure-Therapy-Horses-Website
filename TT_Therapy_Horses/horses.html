            <p>He is the clown in our herd, always making us laugh.</p>
            <p>He is bold and brave and willing to go anywhere we ask him to go.</p>

            <p>She is kind and quiet and loves attention and petting.</p>
            <p>Fun fact about Tilly: she turns dark brown when her winter coat comes in, so it's like owning two totally different horses from spring to winter.</p>
