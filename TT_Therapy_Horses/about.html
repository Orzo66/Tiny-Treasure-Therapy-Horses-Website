    <p>Tiny Treasures Therapy Horses operated by Heather Bowman has been serving the community since 2024. Heather and her team of three minature therapy horses visit assisted living, memory care, neurological and physical rehabilitation centers in Southeastern Michigan. Her focus is on the elderly, individuals with disabilities and our beloved veterans. It truly is a family affair as you will often see her mother, Carolyn, and husband, Dan along on her visits.</p>
